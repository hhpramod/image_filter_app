# Transformative Image Filters Using OpenCV
This project explores the creation of various artistic image filters using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. The goal is to mimic popular photo editing effects seen in applications like Photoshop and Instagram. By experimenting with a wide range of filters, we aim to produce unique and visually appealing renderings of original images. The project also includes deploying these filters through a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to apply and view these effects in real-time. This interactive approach not only demonstrates the capabilities of OpenCV but also provides a hands-on experience in image processing and web app deployment.
