# image_filter_app
This project explores the creation of various artistic image filters using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. The goal is to mimic popular photo editing effects seen in applications like Photoshop and Instagram. By experimenting with a wide range of filters, we aim to produce unique and visually appealing renderings of original images
